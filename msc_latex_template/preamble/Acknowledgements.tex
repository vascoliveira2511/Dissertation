\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
\setlength{\parskip}{1em}

I sincerely thank the following individuals for their direct or indirect help in this academic endeavor.

Firstly, I thank my supervisors, Maria Solange and Jos√© Ribeiro. The former for providing me with the guidance needed for writing and completing this dissertation, and the latter for helping me through the research and technical implementation of the proposal. Without them, this work would have been next to impossible.

I also extend my heartfelt appreciation to my team at Altice Labs, specifically the Platforms Services Department, for providing me with a fantastic work experience while maintaining a friendly and welcoming environment, all while supporting me and giving me the most significant guidance for the success of this solution.

I also acknowledge the spectacular opportunity given to me by Inova-Ria's partnership with Altice Labs. Without their proposal, this research would have certainly not happened, and I would have been without this incredible venture.

The funding provided by the Genius fund was also essential for supporting my expenses to complete my work. Had they been absent, the financial toll would have been tremendous and the undertaking of this opportunity arduous.

I also need to acknowledge the value and importance of my friends and peers. Their motivation and struggle through similar experiences helped me overcome the challenges while working on the project. This initiative would have been more treacherous without their presence during this time.

Finally, but not less importantly, I thank everyone at the University of Minho for providing me, throughout these five years, with the knowledge needed to finally step into the professional world with a fantastic learning foundation. The ventures I had and the acquaintances and friends I have made shaped me into the person I am today.
